        "The Botanical Garden at the University of Warsaw is a favorite vacation spot for Warsaw residents. It was discovered in 1818 through the efforts of professor of botany Michal Schubert . It was located in the northern part of the Royal Lazienki Park and occupied 22.5 hectares. The creators divided the garden into three areas: research, horticulture and walking - for the general public. The botanical garden developed rapidly: in 1824 there were already more than 10 thousand species of plants . Then sad times began for the University of Warsaw and for the Garden along with it: after the January uprising, the university was closed, and the area of ​​the Garden was reduced, then Professor Schubert was removed from his post of director. The Botanical Garden was in decline until 1916, and then came under the control of the revived University of Warsaw. Gradually, the garden regained its scientific and cultural value.The second difficult test came during World War II. All buildings and greenhouses were destroyed, and the area turned into a cemetery for a once rich collection of plants. Afterwards, painstaking work began to restore the Botanical Garden. Thanks to the efforts and enthusiasm of the staff, it was possible to return the Botanical Garden to its former glory - in 1965 it was included in the register of Achievements of Science and Culture of the capital of Poland.Every spring, starting in April, the Botanical Garden opens its doors to all nature lovers, children and their teachers. In the schedule of events you can see the week of magnolias and azaleas - in May, Night of Museums , Rose Festival - at the end of June. Festival \"Plants, Bees and Honey\" - in September and much more. There are educational games for children and guided tours. The entrance ticket costs 12 PLN for adults and 6 PLN for pupils, students and pensioners. Children under 6 years of age and students of the University of Warsaw can visit the Botanical Garden for free. Excursions can be booked from PLN 100 per group.From March 30 , come to Alei Ujazdowske 4 !https://isttravel.ru/index.pl?act=PRODUCT&id=317",

        """Where can you go for a walk in Warsaw if the main tourist spots are already well-trodden? There are many rainy days in October, but as soon as the sun comes out, you want to go for a walk. Together with the naszemiasto.pl portal, we have selected 10 off-the-beaten-path places for walks:1) You can choose a forest park - comfortable paths, benches, fresh air. Mlochinsky Park, Kabatsky Forest, Shchenslivsky Park - there is an option to choose closer to yourself, or, on the contrary, you can explore new routes. In Szczesliwski Park, sports fans will find something to do on the Hill of the same name.2) See the extraordinary chapels in the Prague region. None of them are like the others. They survived the war and are lovingly preserved by local residents.3) in the Wola area you can walk next to metal sculptures. The Symbol of Will, the iconic metal structures along Kasprzak Street, is now under threat of being moved to another location, as they plan to launch a tram line there.4) Roof of the university library . From there you can see the right bank of the Vistula and part of the left with high-rise buildings.5) Lovers of mystical secrets can stroll along Starzyńskiego Street in the area of ​​the Cholera Cemetery, the most mysterious necropolis in Warsaw. The cemetery was closed for a long time, and then it was equipped thanks to the friendly townspeople. It is noteworthy that there is not a single official road leading there. The naszemiasto portal advises from Starzyńskiego Street to go deep into the thicket near the railway embankment.6) Would you like to see the historical gas lamps moved from Śródmieście? They can be seen in the area of ​​Platnicha and Tseglovskaya streets on Belany, as well as on Agricoli.https://isttravel.ru/index.pl?act=PRODUCT&id=227 
7) Grzybowski Square - a triangular square in the very center of Warsaw, where there is a pleasant square with paths, flower beds and ponds, and all this among skyscrapers. The place is beautifully illuminated in the evening.8) Have you heard about the neon road of Okhota? Take a stroll in the evening and you'll be able to see around 15 post-war neon signs lining Gruecka Street. You can start your walk from Narutoviča Square, where there are interesting kamenitsa (residential buildings) from tsarist times.9) In the Wola district there is a very nice place - Chlodna Street, which is now “hidden” due to the lack of access to Jan Paul II Alley. You will love the cute square ks. Popelushki, we also recommend not to pass by the Firefighting Museum (there has been a fire station here since 1851). Also pay attention to the Church of St. Karol Boromeusz in the neo-Renaissance style.https://isttravel.ru/index.pl?act=PRODUCT&id=227
10) If you prefer cycling to walking, we suggest checking out the cycling route along the right bank of the Vistula. First, you can drive along the newly opened passage over the Lazienkowski Bridge, then drive towards Prague past the beaches of Maska Kenpa, and then the path will go under the Poniatowski Bridge opposite the boulevards. It will be possible to see Stare and Nowo Miasto, as well as Powiśle. Well, stop for a snack in one of the many bars and cafes.""",

        """The Guardian recently released a review of the most interesting museums in Europe. Only one Polish museum was included in it, but it was placed in an honorable second place. This is indeed a very unusual museum of neon signs from the Polish People's Republic. The museum's exposition reminds everyone of the so-called period of "great neonization", which was carried out in life in the countries of the Warsaw bloc. In Poland, neonization at one time was carried out on a grand scale, with the involvement of famous artists from the Polish Poster School, known throughout the world.This private museum opened in 2005 and is open 6 days a week (except Wednesdays). He also runs a "Renovation" campaign to preserve and restore existing old neon signs in Warsaw. Ticket price is 15 zlotys. It is located at st. Minska 55 in the Prague area.In addition to the Warsaw Neon Museum, the list also includes the Albert Kahn Museum in Paris - early color photographs, the Automobile Fashion Museum in Malaga, the Film Museum in Girona, the National Museum of Iceland, the Old Town Museum in Aarhus (Denmark), the M9 Museum in Mestre (coastal Venice) , MAMBO Museum in Bologna, House of Music in Vienna.""",

    content: """Do you know which type of coffee is considered the most expensive in the world? Connoisseurs will answer without hesitation - Luwak coffee (kopi luwak). This is a very specific coffee, the beans of which first pass through the digestive tract of small Indonesian animals, the Musang. Then the grains are cleaned, dried, washed again, dried again, fried and crushed. The high cost of receipt and processing affects the price of the finished drink in coffee shops. In the Warsaw restaurant Cava, a cup of such coffee costs 90 zlotys (for example, a cup of coffee usually costs from 7 to 16 zlotys in Warsaw coffee shops).The establishment on the fashionable street of the capital Nowy Świat, as you might guess, is not cheap. Breakfast costs 18-29 zlotys, a portion of pancakes costs 22 zlotys, and a large barbecue burger for two costs 64 zlotys. However, from Monday to Friday you can eat lunch there with soup and a main course for 25 zlotys. The establishment also serves Spanish tapas, three types of wood-fired pizza and a large selection of desserts.Cava is also available in the Zlote Tarasy shopping center in the very center of the capital. If you have 90 zlotys for the experiment, and you are not against kopi luwak for ethical reasons (many are unhappy with keeping animals in cages on special farms), then we can try unusual coffee. A small cup costs 60 zł - this is how much a portion of the main dish usually costs in a good restaurant. Or you can take a regular latte for 14 zlotys and homemade sernik for 16 zlotys - the cheapest dessert on the menu. The address of the establishment is Novy Svyat, 30. On weekdays the restaurant is open from 9 am, on weekends - from 10 to 24.00""",

The child will be able to get acquainted with the animals and birds that live in this area, solve fascinating puzzles, and play an instrument called a dendrophone.
Another unusual adventure is the tree trail. Five high wooden platforms are connected by suspension bridges that even small children can walk across. Along the way, you can watch the birds and find out their names thanks to information signs.
