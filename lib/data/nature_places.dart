    content: """The Karkonosze National Park was formally established on January 16th in 1959. It is located in south-western Poland, on the Czech border. The Park area covers northern slopes of the Karkonosze, which are the highest and largest range of the Sudetes, starting from the Okraj Pass (1046 m) in the east up to Mumlawski Wierch (1219 m) in the west.
It is a mountainous region that is among the most valuable landscapes and natural habitats of Central Europe. Its area size is 5,575 ha, 70% (3,828 ha) are covered with forest vegetation. The area under strict protection includes the entire sub-alpine and alpine zone of 1,717 ha (ca. 30%). The remaining area is under partial protection, aiming at restoration of damaged or destroyed components of natural environment and at maintaining the ecological balance of some important ecosystem elements. Surrounding the Park there is a protection area of 11,266 ha. This zone is managed by local Forest Inspectors of Szklarska Poręba, Kowary and Kamienna Góra. Additionaly, the Park includes two enclaves situated within the Park protection zone: the Szklarska waterfall (55 ha) and Chojnik Hill (80 ha).
The national border also divides the Karknosze National Park from the Czech Krknoše National Park, which was established in 1963. Its area, together with park protection zone, has a size of more than 55,000 ha.The main objectives of the Park’s constitution include: maintenance of natural or nearly-natural ecosystems to protect biodiversity and complexity of the ecological systems, restoration of damaged or destroyed phytocenoses and zoocenoses, keeping the balance between the ecological processes, the limitation of anthropogenic threats (mainly by minimizing environment-aggressive forms of tourism in the Park area) on the one hand and scientific research and monitoring to increase the knowledge of the Park’s natural resources and to work them out with efficient methods on the other hand.""",

The lower slopes are dominated by fir and beech forest mixed with spruce and sycamore trees. Spruce, mountain ash and dwarf mountain pine predominate in the upper slopes. An Alpine area, with its rare mountain plant species, is higher still. Hollows and gullies filled with rock debris are prevalent in the highest, less fertile areas.
The highest peak, Diablak, has an Alpine quality to it. The forest shelters a multitude of animals including bears, red deer, wolf and lynx and is also the habitat of such rare bird species as the wood grouse.""",

    content: """Poland’s historic sites number in the thousands, but only one can claim it has been standing the longest - Bialowieza Forest. This ancient forest sits on the border between Poland and Belarus, in Podlasie Region. UNESCO named the site a Biosphere Reserve in 1977 and two years later, it also joined the UNESCO World Heritage List. It is the last European lowland deciduous and mixed forest in existence. The Bialowieza represents the forest that once covered most of Europe.
This primeval forest is home to animal and plant species typical of both Eastern and Western Europe. It’s the only place in the world where you can see European bison freely roaming. Some other species that call the forest home include elk, wolves, red and roe deer, lynx, and wild boar. Amidst the pine, oak, spruce, and beech that compose the bulk of the forest, you’ll find trees that are much older than any human can ever hope to live. There are over 900 different plant species that have made their home in the woodland. Rare avian species such as peregrine falcon, white stork, and white-tailed eagle flutter about the picturesque forest.
An area of about 40 square miles of the forest is protected as a natural park. And a visit to that part is only possible as part of a guided tour or official scientific expedition. Visitors can enjoy the sights by foot or horse-drawn carriage. The National Park takes care to ensure that this part of the forest remains undisturbed and breathing the ancient air is an experience well worth the moderate tour fee. There are several hiking and cycling trails that go through the forest. Organized bird watching with expert guides is another popular way to get the most out of a visit to the forest.Visitors can opt to stay a village of Bialowieza. There you can find lodging and dining and recreation. There are a few monuments and historical buildings, a palace and parks complex, and a Natural History Museum.
Poland’s UNESCO World Heritage sites are all worth visiting, but this is one of the best. Even those with only a passing interest in nature will become speechless by the sheer magnitude of the Bialowieza Forest. If you want to see a truly wild place when you visit Poland, this is it!""",

    content: """The largest of all Poland’s national parks, the Biebrzański National Park protects Europe’s major natural expanse of moorland peat bogs which are extend across the Biebrza River valley. The peat bogs occupy an area of 59,223 hectares.
The greatest attraction of the park is the splendid, open, high moor topography and the uncommonly rich wildlife and plant cover.
The Biebrza River marshes are known worldwide as the nesting site of many rare species of European aquatic birds and birds of prey (approx. 235 species, including 157 nesting birds).In spring, when the Biebrza overflows its several square kilometer flood plain, thousands of migratory birds gather here and can be watched from viewing platforms.
The Biebrza River Valley is also Poland’s largest wildlife refuge for elk, wolf, beaver, and otter. The Biebrzański National Park attracts many enthusiasts of a bloodless form of hunting, most of them armed with cameras and microphones.The park is under the protection of the RAMSAR International Convention.""",

During the traditional raft and kayak trips down the Dunajec River, visitors are able to admire the picturesque crags and peaks, steep rocky walls and several hundred meter high precipices dropping down to the river.
Lush flora abounds in a number of endemic and reintroduced species of plants like the Pieniny dandelion and the Pieniny wallflower. Mixed beech and fir forests are predominant in the area. Barren slopes and ledges are covered with small, pine forests.
The exceptionally rich and interesting wildlife and the insect population – of butterflies in particular – are a distinctive feature of the meadows nestled in the forest glades and on the rocky slopes. Among the multitude of butterflies there are the Apollo Butterfly and the rarer Swallowtail Butterfly. Amphibians and reptiles under total protection include the triturus, the spotted salamander, the common European adder and others. Mammals are represented mostly by rodents and 17 species of bats. Among the bird population the wallcreeper is to be specially noted.""",
