        """The Valley of Five Ponds is a must-visit for all mountain lovers. Its name comes from the five glacial ponds that are located there: Front Polish Pond, Back Polish Pond, Greater Polish Pond, Lesser Polish Pond and Black Polish Pond. In the past, about half a century ago, local residents grazed their cattle in this valley, but since 1968 this has been prohibited by the Tatra National Park authorities to preserve the local flora and fauna. Since that time, tourists regularly visit the Valley of Five Ponds, so good infrastructure has been developed here. You will find many safe hiking trails and stopovers. Interestingly, there are actually six bodies of water in the Valley of Five Ponds. In addition to the five ponds, at an altitude of 1862 meters above sea level, there is another small lake - Wole-Oko.Cliffs on the island of Wolin / Klify na wyspie Wolin
The island of Wolin, close to the German border, offers the highest and most impressive vertical slopes, known as cliffs, on the Baltic coast. These cliffs stretch along the coast for 15 kilometers. The highest of them, Gostań, forms an almost perpendicular angle with a narrow rocky beach, giving the impression of a vertical wall. From the top of this slope there is a magnificent view of the Pomeranian Bay (Zatoka Pomorska), the resorts of Międzyzdroje and Świniujście. If the weather is favorable, you can even see the Polish-German island of Usedom from Gostan. Many consider the cliffs of Wolin Island to be the most beautiful place on the Baltic coast. At the foot of the slopes you can find the stumps of old forest beech trees, and on their tops grow rare plants such as orchis, eryngium and Pomeranian honeysuckle. The Wolinsky National Park deserves special attention, where you can see old beeches and other unique plants. Another popular tourist attraction on the island is the local bison nursery. 
Dunajca Canyon / Przełom Dunajca w Pieninach

        """This beautiful lake is located in the Tatra National Park, at the foot of the Menguszowieckie peaks. Surrounded by mountains, some of which rise thousands of meters above its surface, it delights with its beauty. Usually tourists reach this place starting from Palenica Bialczanska and then continue on foot to cover 9 kilometers. For those who find it difficult to walk such a distance, horse-drawn carriages are available. The popular Polish resort of Zakopane is located 25 kilometers from the lake. Morskie Oko is associated with many legends. One of them tells about a nobleman who lived here with his beautiful wife and five daughters. One day he went hunting and did not return. From the tears of his wife Morskie Oko was formed, and from the tears of his daughters other lakes in the Tatras were formed. Another legend claims that the lake is connected by underground streams to the Adriatic Sea. The place attracts not only tourists, but also artists who want to capture its unique beauty on canvas. The depth of the lake is more than 50 meters. In 2014, one of the most influential newspapers in the world, The Wall Street Journal, included Morskie Oko among the five most beautiful lakes on the planet.

Słowiński Park Narodowy
The Park contains one of the largest complexes of moving sand dunes in Europe, the height of which reaches 30 meters.

Słowinski National Park is located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland, on the territory of two administrative regions: Słupsk and Lębork. The park is located on the middle part of the Baltic Sea coast, known as the Slowinskie coast, between the settlements of Leba and Rowy. The park's territory includes lakes Lebsko (the third largest in Poland, with an area of ​​7,140 hectares) and Gardno (with an area of ​​2,468 hectares), as well as two smaller lakes: Dolgie Wielkie (with an area of ​​156 hectares) and Dolgie Male (with an area of ​​6.3 hectares) . The main area with sand dunes is located on the Lebska Spit, a narrow isthmus separating Lake Lebsko from the Baltic Sea, as well as on the coastline to the mouth of the Lupawa River. The park has a network of tourist roads with a length of 140 kilometers, which pass through the most interesting places. In the cities of Leba, Cholpin and Rovy, tourists can find places to stay overnight. The park is also of important ethnographic value, since on its territory there are material cultural monuments of the ethnic groups - Kashubians and Slovinians.""",

It is located in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship in north-eastern Poland, between the Vistula and Niemen rivers. Here is the heart of Masuria. This area contains the largest lakes in Poland – Śniardwy (Polish) and Mamry (Polish). Together with numerous smaller bodies of water, they form a complex network of channels covering a total surface area of ​​more than 480 square kilometers. The main transport hub in this region is the city of Ełk (Polish: Ełk).
Elbląg Canal
The Elbląg Canal, the longest shipping canal in Poland, is located next to the city of Elbląg and connects the Iławske Lake District (a system of lakes in the vicinity of the cities of Iława and Ostróda) ​​with the Vistula Lagoon of the Baltic Sea. The canal is located in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship and is equipped with five ramps that make it easier to cross sections between lakes and differences in water levels. A unique feature of the canal is that in order to cross the isthmuses between the lakes, ships sometimes glide on grass instead of floating on water! The canal was built in the mid-19th century as a link between Prussia and the Baltic Sea at the whim of the king. The cost of its construction exceeded the cost of erecting the Eiffel Tower, and the designers faced a serious obstacle - a more than 100-meter difference in levels between the cities of Ostróda and Elblag. They dealt with this problem by creating a unique rail system for moving ships, known as a “dry ridge.” This engineering solution has no analogues in the world, with the exception of the United States.""",
